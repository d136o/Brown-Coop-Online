Q: Can I snack on coop food?
A: Yes. We are pro-snackers. You will find no better place to snack.

Q: What kind of snacks do you have?
A: It varies, but we have fruits, various nuts, nutella, cookies and crackers, cereal, and of course you can always slice a tomato and put a little salt on it (yum). If we don't have it we can get it (within reason, but aren't all snacks so?)

A: About two hours. Cooking begins at 4:30pm, additionally something is thawed overnight or during the day but that requires no supervision from the cooks.
